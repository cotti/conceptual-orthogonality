# Wait, what?

Felipe Cotti, 38 years old. 

Sense is something we have to make, and I feel as if there's already too much of it around.

## No, seriously, say something.

I miss blogs. I miss the search in the early 2000s for folks saying interesting stuff - what a teenager at the time would, at least. Turns out it didn't change much, but got nuanced.

## What's going to be like here?

This is a conscious effort to better structure my environment. So it'll be the usual mish-mash.

In short, expect it to be the equivalent of some chit-chat.
