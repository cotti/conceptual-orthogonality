Here I am doing this yet again. A tad different this time, though.

I did even migrate the old blog posts here and everything (*portuguese only, sorry or you're welcome*). But from now on, the blog's bilingual.

The goal: try and pull some marginally technical stuff here. And well, structure. Structure, structure. I need it. It's been almost a week since I started trying to write and publish this very post. Then I fall into a rabbit hole, and before I notice it, it's already the next day and everything's late.
